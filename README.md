# Parallels-Desktop-trial-bypass
A collection of the programs that I have found to bypass a expired parallels desktop trail

Parallels-reset.sh is the code from this pastbin https://pastebin.com/CVdThLx0 that I found when browsing a form.

PD.Runner.app.zip was from the release section of https://github.com/tcgmilan/pd-runner

I tested both of these scripts on parallels desktop 17, with an expired trial. With only using PD Runner, I was able to start my already made window 11 vm, but I needed to use Parallels-reset.sh to reset the trial to start a newly created vm, after my trial had expired.

#Steps to run each program

PD Runner:
Download PD.Runner.app.zip and unextract it
Move PD Runner to your applications folder
Run PD Runner
This will create a menu bar icon where you can start parallels desktop's vm's

Parallels-reset.sh:
Download Parallels-reset.sh
Fully close both Parallels Deskop and PD Runner
run Parallels-reset.sh using `sudo sh Parallels-reset.sh`
Launch Parallels Deskop
You will need to log into a new account to activate the new trail, I found that using my google account worked well
